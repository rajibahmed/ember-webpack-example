# Ember Webpack Example

TodoMVC app implemented using Ember + webpack

The app was implemented using more resources from Ember than the original todomvc ember to validate if the integration is working well.

This project uses the NPM package [ember-webpack-loaders](https://github.com/tulios/ember-webpack-loaders) to ease the integration and it was based on the knowledge of this [http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/can-i-use-ember-with-npm-and-webpack/9160](http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/can-i-use-ember-with-npm-and-webpack/9160).
