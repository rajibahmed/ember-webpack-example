# Ember Webpack Example

TodoMVC app implemented using Ember + webpack

The app was implemented using more resources from Ember than the original todomvc ember to validate that the integration is working well. This project uses the NPM package [ember-webpack-loaders](https://github.com/tulios/ember-webpack-loaders) to ease the integration.
